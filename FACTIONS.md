## Current Idea
- Have many factions extant in the setting; **five** as the default available to the average player - notable for their power, scope and relative ubiquity compared to the bit players.
- Have each faction be palpably different;
	- Each faction should have a different **philosophy**
		- _Why is Magic_; _What does being Awakened mean_
	- A different  **burden**
		- _Each faction should have some demands in what they expect of a member; what does a given org expect of their initiates_
	- A different **cause**
		- _The overall organisation should have a mission, mode of existence or otherwise overarching system dictating the way they work and strive. This should be distinct from all other factions_



- Concept - generate five factions from the MTG colour pie
	- BLUE - The Scholars
		- Minor colour -
			- WHITE = Big on order, 'rules', respectability politics. Members/the insitution have some ONE TRUE VISION that they build towards
			- BLACK = More ruthless, power for powers sake
		- Inspo: Brakebills, Serpents Hand, Order of Hermes
		- Likely would prize abillity to solve problems/learn lore. Membership may come with Mystery-tax. The secret-economy of TWI's hogwarts expy may work here.
		- Possible origins: Alexandria, Actual Atlantis, ???
		- Wackaloon idea; 
			- membership removes one's natural 'sleep', you teleport to a big fuckoff castle in the collective unconciousness, where this faction stores their Grand Library. Advantage in that information can be easily shared across wide areas, bad in that the culture of this faction demands alot of ones time asleep must be spent manuvering around others.
	- BLACK  
		- Minor colour - 
		- Politckers/Conspiracy leaders/Mob bosses
		- "Magic is Might"
		- Origin: im thinking these guys arose amid a period of chaos. Offbranch of the Medici's maybe? Warring state period?
		- I like the idea of having this faction be in perma-war against another other 'ambitious' faction - would explain why the world isnt black-controlled
		- These guys may have written the mage code of haruambi originally maybe??? 
		- Inspo: Great Game, any number of dark academia settings (IoM's Houses in particular maybe?) 
	 - RED
		 - Artists and fighters?
		 - Could be the 'crafting' faction maye, or do a sixth unofficial one for them
	- GREEN
		- Something somethijng 'The Natural'. Paganism?
		- Green ties to 'the community'. Who do these mages have as a 'community'? Kinfolk type setup? Weird homesteads?
		- AVOID DOING THE DREAMWALKERS AGAIN. SOBEK ABOVE
		- Familiars and shapeshifting?? 
		- Wackaloon idea;
			- Riff of Rowlings 'Wizards like weirdos!' thing. Have this be an ancient order of counter-culturalists
	- WHITE 
		- Either lawmakewrs, preachers, or some other kind of thing
		- Monastic order?? Vibe of ascetism, stripping down Faith to its platonic form, combining all creeds and paring them bck to form some vague Dao?
		- Equally, just have these guys be White/Black - the Guardians of the Veil, an ancient order of mages (nobody really knows how long they've been knocking around, but they've been present in every faith) who police 'normality'. Big on infosec, Mystery-management and shows of force. The type to declare 'heresy'!
