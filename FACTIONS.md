## Current Idea
- Have many factions extant in the setting; **five** as the default available to the average player - notable for their power, scope and relative ubiquity compared to the bit players.
- Have each faction be palpably different;
	- Each faction should have a different **philosophy**
		- _Why is Magic_; _What does being Awakened mean_
	- A different  **burden**
		- _Each faction should have some demands in what they expect of a member; what does a given org expect of their initiates_
	- A different **cause**
		- _The overall organisation should have a mission, mode of existence or otherwise overarching system dictating the way they work and strive. This should be distinct from all other factions_



- Concept - generate five factions from the MTG colour pie
	- BLUE 
		- Scholars
		- Inspo: Brakebills, Serpents Hand
	- BLACK  
		- Politckers/Mobsters
		- Inspo: Great Game, Wormverse superheros and villians (??)
	 RED 
	- GREEN 
	- WHITE
