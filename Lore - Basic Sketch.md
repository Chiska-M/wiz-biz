- Mages are humans who have been given access to Magic by the intercession of one of five (or more?) ancient entities entombed in Grand Towers in a realm beyond time and space known as the **Pleroma**. Once, man first fashioned magic from binding entities of unimaginable power to towers such as these, yet now only five still stand and magic is held by scant few.
- The Pleroma is not a higher supernal truth from which the world was derived, but merely a part of reality; a corner untouched by the myriad changes that have echoed through the world of the Chronicles of Darkness.
- Mortals become Mages in a variety of ways; though there is always the **Mystery**, some issue or trauma or brush with the supernatural which fundamentally rocks a person to their core. Every mage begins by choosing to pursue this Mystery, to delve into disquieting darkness rather than the comfort of ignorance. Portents and signs amass around the mortal; eventually seeing them crossing over into a state which is neither sanity nor madness -- a Querrent is not yet a mage, yet as they sleep they breathe in the air of the Pleroma, and if they find their way to a tower and earn the approval of its captive; they will fully Awaken.
- It is widely believed that magehood itself is a long-con by the captives of this tower; a bid to break them from their prisons -- and it is widely believed that even one of these entities being freed would see the entire world as we know it to be totally remade.
