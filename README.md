# So What is this Anyways?
Herein you find the rueful brain-rot of one `H. Chiska Mivtefen-Cztepramiv "I Can't Believe It's not Bunkum" Bartichoke Terribly Hyonklo, Hyonklo`, into the remediation of the tabletop role-playing game Mage: The Awakening.


# MAw-ist Thought, and it's Discontents
Though much has been said by ~~loathsome crybabies~~ those who were fans of the old World of Darkness incarnation of Mage and displeased with Mage: The Awakening (henceforth 'Maw'); this project focuses on the following complaints:
### Issues with the Setting
- Feeling
	- Mage doesn't feel _magical_. The mages of canon Maw tap a form of reality warping that, while powerful and based on interesting concept, fails to deliver on the creation of a sense of wonder or enchantment on an aesthetic level
	- The factions are bland and don't feel tied down to the setting
		- The werewolf approach of having several different 'branches' of the same super-organisation feels wrong here, the vampire approach of having different organisations/sects formed at different places and times to answer universal problems experienced by the splat is likely a much better route.
		- The way that the 'interfactional politics' really just seems to be boiled down to one-note sassy quips between the different orgs and each having completely separate organisational hierarchies that they might impose upon a territory (Not an inherently bad thing, VtR does a similar thing; though the level of focus it is given is _criminal_ in a sourcebook)
	- e
- Story-Engine Plumbing
	- Villains
		- Seers of the Throne are simultaneously uninteresting, teetering on Anti-Semitic Lizard-person conspiracy nonsense, and too powerful.
		- The SoT exist as the manifestation of the Exarchs evil in the setting - and this is a problem.
			- The Exarchs are otherworldly entities who have some nebulous-yet-godlike level of power. They are villains we can loosely assign blame for the Fallen World being the way it is, with the extent of their sinister plans being incredibly unclear. This is AWFUL for a setting villain - your Pentex and Technocracy of oWOD while being presented as powerful were **at the very least** merely very powerful rather than operating at a similar level as a creator god who cannot be easily deposed or defied.

### Issues with the System
- Acamoth and Gulmoth should be expanded/reworked
